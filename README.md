this is the readme file for the entire project. here we will justify the choices we made in the project.

## Project Structure

the project is structured as follows:

- `api-svc`: this is the service that contains the api endpoints and talks to the database.
- `web-svc`: this is the service that contains the web client.

## Why we chose this structure

- we chose this structure because it is a good way to organize the project.
- it is easy to understand and navigate.
- it is easy to deploy and scale the project.
- it is easy to test and maintain the project.


We'll be adding more to this file later.
